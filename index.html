      <p>
        “The idea was to try and make a frontier space music of some kind,” Eno said in a 1998 interview. “When I was asked to do the music for the film, I discovered that the astronauts were each allowed to take a cassette with them on those missions, and they nearly all took country and western songs. I thought it was a fabulous idea that people were in space, playing this music which really belongs to another frontier-in a way, seeing themselves as cowboys.”
